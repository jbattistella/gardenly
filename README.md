# GardenAppProject
vegetable gardening app

##Summary
The projected outlined here will be to create an application (gardenapp) that, given user information (zipcode), returns information about what vegetables can be planted at the time of the request got their given growing zone. The project will involve creating a DB of vegetable types and their growing times in relation to the hardiness zones in the United States, and an api server that can take in user information and return a list of vegetables.

I will demonstrate the following:

1.Building a REST API in Go.
2.Creating and interacting with a postgres DataBase.
3.Acting as a client to api's in order to gather hardiness zone by zipcode.
4.Testing of HTTP handlers
5.Testing of Http Client

#User Stories
